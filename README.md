# Townqs - Possora *{post sorter}*

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application using GraphQL and Apollo Server for the backend, and a web app (React.js) for the frontend. The application leverages the power of GraphQL for managing the reordering of a list of posts, using drag-and-drop and the ApolloServer Sandbox. 

- Frontend access: https://townsq-possora.vercel.app/
- Backen endpoint and greeting: https://monkfish-app-62qqa.ondigitalocean.app/
    - For GraphQL queries: https://monkfish-app-62qqa.ondigitalocean.app/graphql

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm
- A running instance of MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    
    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
    cd yourprojectname
    
    ```
    
2. Set up environment variables for both the backend and frontend.
3. Install dependencies and run the project:

---

### **Backend:**

**Create an .env file at the root of /server**

```jsx
#create an .env file at the root of /server
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/townsquare
PORT=4000
CORS_WHITELIST=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

---

### **Frontend:**

```jsx
#create an .env file at the root of /webapp
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql
```

```bash
cd webapp
npm install
npm start
```

1. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the GraphQL API at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.
2. There is a Mutation that clears and seeds the Collection. `reseedPosts`

---

### Apolo Sandbox

Access the sandbox here: ðŸ”—Â [link](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer)

Set the endpoint to the serverâ€™s GraphQL endpoint

```jsx
# API Endpoint
https://monkfish-app-62qqa.ondigitalocean.app/graphql
# WS Endpoint
ws://monkfish-app-62qqa.ondigitalocean.app/graphql
```

**Query**

```graphql
query GetPosts {
  getPosts {
    id
    title
    content
    emoji
    order
    createdAt
  }
}
```

**Mutations**

```graphql
# Mutation to change the order of a specific post

mutation UpdatePostOrder($updatePostOrderId: ID!, $isUpperLimit: Boolean!, $refOrder: Float!, $emitEvent: Boolean) {
  updatePostOrder(id: $updatePostOrderId, isUpperLimit: $isUpperLimit, refOrder: $refOrder, emitEvent: $emitEvent)
}

# Copy and paste this onto Variables section:
{
  "updatePostOrderId": "66bda7dca742970a5cd05255",
  "isUpperLimit": true,
  "refOrder": 3.52,
	"emitEvent":true
}

# There you have: 
#the POST ID
# the boundary or limit
# the order value of the element where the boundary is
# a Flag to emit a signal to those clients subscribed to updates

```

---

```graphql
# Mutation to reset the database with the 300 original Posts
mutation ReseedPosts {
  reseedPosts
}
```

**Subscription**

```graphql
subscription PostReordered {
  updatedPost {
    id
    title
    content
    order
    emoji
    createdAt
  }
}
```

## Available Scripts

- **Backend:**
    - `npm start`: Start the server.
- **Frontend:**
    - `npm start`: Start the development server.

## Assumptions and Design Decisions

- **GraphQL Usage:** The application uses GraphQL for API communication to provide flexible and efficient data retrieval. 
It has a main Query, getPosts. It receives params for pagination.
- **Apollo Server:** Useful as well for creating websockets that will enable the front end and the Sandbox to subscribe to updates, in one of the Subscriptions created: `updatedPost`
- **Frontend Framework:** The frontend uses React with Typescript, and as main libraries, there is
    - [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for seamless integration with the GraphQL API.
    - [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/), for responsive, and beautiful and easy-to-use UI components
    - [DnDToolkit](https://docs.dndkit.com/), for ordering the list of posts using the `Sortable` module.
- **Database Choice:** MongoDB  was selected for its flexibility and scalability in handling the data model. `Mongoose` was the ORM selected for this purpose.
- **Reordering Logic:** I chose to execute the sorting function by using an approach of a destination and a boundary. Depending on the boundary, the algorithm woud attempt to either insert the moved post in between the two numbers closest to the chosen position.
